## Blog Prompt 2

Read both of the following:
  - Chapter 1 in [The Art of Community](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EI6YcKlTdzojLD4RdVjYVlmFRTNzzge0/view?usp=sharing) pp 1-20 paper or pp 33-52 pdf
  - [FOSS Definitions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNo951BpIq1Kmyk8BTLN95qXJknrqkXaESGrYebyx-w/edit?usp=sharing)

In your second blog entry of the semester, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraph each):
  - Identify what you see as the key points from the Chapter 1 reading, and then identify one of these to discuss how you see it relating to you personally.
  - Discuss what is meant by the social economy, several ways it is like the monetary economy, its value in FOSS development, and its value to you in your future.
  - Referencing ideas from your readings, how do you envision ways community is *fostered* in the FOSS movement?

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)
  
The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md) of the differences
between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
  
### Please note that blog prompts are due by 8 am on their due dates --do not wait until the last minute!
